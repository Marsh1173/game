# Things that would be nice to do

-   Finish README.md XD
-   It feels like there could be more collision logic between players sometimes. Not really sure what would be best here.
-   Modular platforms and a way to create "levels" that players could play on with their own platform design
-         This would first require a platform class, and generalized platform/player collision logic that would work independently of the platform and player involved
