# Things that would be nice to do

-   Finish README.md XD
-   It feels like there could be more collision logic between players sometimes. Not really sure what would be best here.
-   Modular platforms and a way to create "levels" that players could play on with their own platform design
-

Fix AI programming
Add items, maybe get rid of classes?
fix health bounce issues?

add player join and player leave messages for client/game.ts

there's a bug where targeted projectiles sometimes die right after being created.
