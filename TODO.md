# Things that would be nice to do

-   Finish README.md XD
-   It feels like there could be more collision logic between players sometimes. Not really sure what would be best here.
-   Modular platforms and a way to create "levels" that players could play on with their own platform design
-

add LOS
fix AI pathing (with platforms and timed aggro)

make player buffs and debuffs into an boolean array?
